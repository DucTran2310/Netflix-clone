# Clone-Netflix using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Styled Components.

I have built the following pages within this application: Sign in, Sign up, Browse and the homepage. 
There are four different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners. 
Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.

## How to use

-   Download or clone this repository.
> https://github.com/DucTran2310/Netflix-clone

-   Go to FireBase Console and create a new project with the correct package name.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
